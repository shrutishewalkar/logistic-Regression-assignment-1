    "Ans: Linear regression is used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables, assuming that the relationship is linear. The output of a linear regression model is a continuous value that represents a prediction of the dependent variable.\n",

    "Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used to model the probability of an event occurring, where the outcome is binary. Logistic regression assumes that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is nonlinear, and the output is a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",

    "A scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression is when the dependent variable is binary or categorical in nature. For example, suppose we want to predict whether a patient has a certain disease or not based on their medical history, age, and gender. In this case, the outcome of interest is binary, and thus logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression."

    "Ans:Regularization is a technique used in logistic regression to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. Regularization works by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which discourages the model from assigning large weights to any one feature, thus reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the penalty term is often expressed as the L1 or L2 norm of the weight vector. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds the sum of the absolute values of the weights to the cost function. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds the sum of the squared values of the weights to the cost function. These penalty terms are multiplied by a regularization parameter lambda, which controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of regularization is to shrink the weights towards zero, thereby reducing the impact of any one feature on the prediction. This can help prevent overfitting, as the model will be less sensitive to noise or irrelevant features in the data. Regularization can also help with feature selection, as it tends to push the weights of irrelevant features towards zero."

    "Ans: The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classification model, such as logistic regression. It plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various thresholds, where the TPR is the proportion of actual positive samples that are correctly predicted as positive, and the FPR is the proportion of actual negative samples that are incorrectly predicted as positive. The area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) is a single number that summarizes the overall performance of the model.\n",

    "Univariate Feature Selection: This technique involves selecting features based on their individual performance in predicting the target variable. The most common method is to use statistical tests such as chi-squared or ANOVA to evaluate the relationship between each feature and the target variable. Features with low p-values are considered significant and are included in the model. The advantage of this technique is its simplicity, but it may not capture interactions between features.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): RFE is an iterative method that starts with all features and removes the least important feature in each iteration until the desired number of features is reached. The importance of each feature is measured by the decrease in the model's performance when the feature is removed. The advantage of this technique is that it considers the interaction between features and can select a subset of features that performs better than using all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: Regularization is a method of adding a penalty term to the cost function that reduces the magnitude of the coefficients, leading to feature selection. L1 regularization (Lasso) tends to produce sparse solutions with some coefficients set to zero, while L2 regularization (Ridge) shrinks all coefficients towards zero. The advantage of regularization is that it reduces overfitting and can improve the model's performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of the feature space by finding a smaller set of uncorrelated variables that explain most of the variance in the data.
